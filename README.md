The aim of this notebook is adjusting a multiple linear regression model. For this purpose, the **Ridge regression** is used, where the objective is to minimize the function

The aim is adjusting a multiple linear regression model to explain a variable $y$ as a function of other variables $X$, $y = X \beta + \epsilon$, where $\beta$ are the adjusted regression coefficients and $\epsilon$ the regression error. For this purpose, the **Ridge Regression** is used, where the objective is to minimize the function:.
